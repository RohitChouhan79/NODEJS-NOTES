1. require the schema/model in the router file(index.js)

2. To be careful from callback hell we use try-catch async-await in the route with the async code

3. CREATING DATA in Database, since we get data in the req.body/req.query, we send the data in the object got from model/schema

CODE(create data):
try{
const obj = new ModelObj(formdata);
await obj.save()

.....furhter code as required

}catch(err){...}


4. READING all data from database, in the route we user the given model/schema object and call "find()" method, further save thr data in variable and use it wherever we want.

CODE(read all data):
try{
const books = await ModelObject.find()
//now we can use "books" in render/json/send

} catch(err){..}
