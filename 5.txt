to transfer data from server/route file(index.js) to ejs(js -> ejs) we user second argument of render method

**second argument of render method is always a JS object, 

we send any type of value in the same same object in the form of {key:value} pair

res.render("ejs_page_name", { key: value})


*if we want to print array in ejs we need to use forEach in ejs file to render each and every element og an array
