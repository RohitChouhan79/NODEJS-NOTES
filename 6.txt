JSON(JavaScript Object Notation) -> Array of Objects

To render json in ejs page we send the array of objects(json) in the second argument of render method in "index.js" file

In order to show json in ejs firstly we user "forEach" to iterate over loop where we get (element,index) and for every element(object) we user "." to print/show it's single value(property).

**we can not directly show object in ejs, we need to show single property of object at a time


**sending data from ejs->js (frontend to backend)

from frontend you can send data in the form of "HTML FORM"

form method -> 1. GET | 2. POST

1. req.query -> "gets data from the URL"
if we want to send the form data in the browser url then we use "GET METHOD", but this technique is not secure since others can see the data in the url

2. req.body -> "get the data in the body(secure)"
if we want to send the data in the secure way then we use "POST METHOD", this send the data hidingly and no one can see the data 

3. req.params -> "use for dynamic routing"


in form there is an "action" attribute and "method"
action -> on which route the form data need to send.

every form element has an attribute "name", this name attribute use to target the value of the form elements to the backend/server
