GET(default)/POST 

request:
query(GET)/body(POST)/params

action: 
takes path(route/url) where we want to send the data

name(attribute): 
there must be name attribute in every form element so that the data can move towards backend

form button:
**form submission is possible only by "submit" type button
by default form button is type of "submit"
we can manully set type to "reset"/"button"


res.send("message") // use to show message in the frontend
res.json([{},{}]) //if we want to show json in the frontend 

res.send/json/render -> we can use one method at a time
