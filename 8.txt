Create an express app

create navigation
Home(/) | About(/about) | Signup(/signup)
make respective pages and render in route

in signup page
create form and take Name,Email,Password
submit the form to "/profile" via "GET" method where "profile.ejs" page render and display all the info.


convert the "/profile" form route into the POST method where the data will get from "req.body" instead of "req.query" , instead of router.get , router.post

->bodyparser is responsibe for activating req.body in app -> the coding lies in app.js
